description: Shelley stood in defiant opposition to many of the cultural and political
  expectations of early 19th-century England. He was expelled from Oxford for his
  vocal criticisms of religion, and his second wife, Mary, came from a family of social
  reformers and cultural agitators. This doctoral dissertation examines the roots
  of Shelley's radicalism and the effect that it had on his work.
